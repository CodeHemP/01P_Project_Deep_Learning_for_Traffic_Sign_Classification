Welcome to "Classify Traffic Signs Using Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars." This is a project-based course which should take approximately 1 hour to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

# Objectives


- Understand the theory and intuition behind __Deep Learning__ and __Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)__.
- Import Key python libraries, dataset and perform image visualization.
- Perform __image normalization__ and __convert images__ from __color-scaled to gray-scaled__.
- Build a __Convolutional Neural Network__ using __Keras__ with __Tensorflow 2.0__ as a back-end.
- Compile and __fit Deep Convolutional Neural Network model__ to __training data__.
- Assess the __performance__ of trained Convolutional Neural Network model and ensure its __generalization__ using various KPIs
